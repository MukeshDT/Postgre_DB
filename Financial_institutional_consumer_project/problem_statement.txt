Consumers are filing complaints against financial institutions about issues related to credit reporting, debt collection, and account management. These complaints highlight potential concerns like incorrect credit information, unauthorized charges, or difficulty resolving disputes. 
Financial companies respond to these complaints, but not all responses are satisfactory, leading to disputes and potential regulatory risks


Problem Statement:
How can financial institutions reduce unresolved complaints and improve response times to enhance customer satisfaction and regulatory compliance?

Why This Problem Matters:
1. Delayed or inadequate responses to consumer complaints can lead to compliance violations and legal penalties
2. Poorly handled complaints increase dissatisfaction and can lead to customer churn
3. Identifying bottlenecks in the complaint resolution process helps companies streamline their operations

Deliverables:
1. Identify companies with the most complaints and highest dispute rates
2. Analyze common complaint types and trends over time
3. Assess which complaint issues remain unresolved
4. Evaluate response times and effectiveness
5. Create a dashboard to visualize company performance and consumer disputes
6. Provide data-driven recommendations for improving complaint resolution
